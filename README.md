# **Digital Preoperative Assessment Pathway and Clinical Decision Support System**

This project was developed as part of a 1st year university assignment, with **AZ Hospital Trust** as a hypothetical client. The patients at AZ Hospital Trust each have 1-hour appointments, leading to a lengthy surgical waiting list and affecting their eligibility for surgery. The hospital's preoperative assessment (POA) process was previously inefficient, with a lot of time spent assessing patients who did not need appointments.

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project was to create a system that could streamline the POA process by identifying patients who need early assessments.

## **Solution**  
The proposed solution was a web application that allows patients to complete the POA questionnaire, making the assessment process more efficient in identifying patients who require appointments.

## **Database**
- SQLite
