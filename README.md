# Digital Preoperative Assessment Pathway and Clinical Decision Support System
**Project Duration:** Mar 4th - Apr 23rd 2024

This project was developed as part of a 1st-year university assignment, with **AZ Hospital Trust** as a hypothetical client. The patients at AZ Hospital Trust each have 1-hour appointments, leading to a lengthy surgical waiting list and affecting their eligibility for surgery. The hospital's preoperative assessment (POA) process was previously inefficient, with a lot of time spent assessing patients who did not need appointments.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to create a system that could streamline the POA process by identifying patients who need early assessments.

## Solution  
The proposed solution was a web application that allows patients to complete the POA questionnaire, making the assessment process more efficient in identifying patients who require appointments.
